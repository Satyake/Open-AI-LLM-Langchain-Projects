#1 Hugging Face transfromer Supervised Fine Tuning on NER use case.


#2 PDF BOT

This one, uses Datastax cassandra DB to do vector search against queries generated by the user. The user queries are converted to text embedding by the LLM and then similarity search happens against the text embeddings.
The NoSQL Cassandra DB is hosted on google cloud. The text embeddings for the pdf are directly computed before pushing the AstralDB. Using this, one can query the pdf and find relevent content.

#3 Transformer fine tuned on text summarization use case. Google/Pegasus model


#4 Resume classification system Bert based

#5 LangChain use cases 

#6 ChromaDB, PineCone, FAISS, RAG implementations notebooks for performing vector search using pdfs.
